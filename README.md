The premise is as follows:
By completing the lessons in this course, you have acquired the necessary HTML and CSS skills and knowledge to develop a home page with a header, main content and footer. You will have to decide whether you are going to use a grid or flexbox layout for your home page. Your header should contain the client logo and the main content should be a large promotional banner with three columns with text and images below it. Your footer will have two columns: the first column should have a small logo and the second one should have copywriting information. When it comes to styling, you'll have to create the appropriate look and feel for your client's target audience. Remember, you want to create intentional engagement!

The client you choose will determine what links, pictures and colors you will use. You are free to use your creativity but the home page needs to meet certain criteria regarding the following:

Visual layout

Semantic structure

CSS layout

CSS styling

CSS effects
